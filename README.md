## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Cloudflare account with Workers AI access (for production)
- AutoRAG dataset configured (see AGENTS.md for production setup)

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run cf-typegen
npm run typecheck
```

### Development

#### Local Development (with AI Mocks)
For local development, the application automatically uses realistic AI mocks to simulate Cloudflare Workers AI responses:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will:
- ‚úÖ Use mock AI responses for vision analysis, AutoRAG, and language generation
- ‚úÖ Provide realistic water damage assessment scenarios
- ‚úÖ Allow full UI testing without Cloudflare AI dependencies
- ‚úÖ Include proper error handling and timeout simulation

#### Production Development (with Real AI)
To test with actual Cloudflare AI services, deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### Environment Variables
You can control the behavior with environment variables:

- `ENABLE_DEV_MOCKS=true` - Force use of AI mocks (default in development)
- `AI_TIMEOUT_MS=5000` - Set AI operation timeout (default: 5s dev, 30s prod)
- `ENABLE_AUTORAG=false` - Disable AutoRAG functionality
- `NODE_ENV=development` - Set environment mode

### Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Configuration

### Development Configuration
No configuration needed for local development - AI mocks are enabled automatically.

### Production Configuration
For production deployment, update `wrangler.jsonc`:

1. **AutoRAG Dataset**: Create and configure your AutoRAG dataset with industry documents:
   ```bash
   # Create AutoRAG dataset (replace with your dataset name)
   wrangler vectorize create auto-inspect-rag
   ```

2. **R2 Bucket**: The bucket `damagescan` is already configured in `wrangler.jsonc`

3. **AI Models**: The following models are pre-configured:
   - Vision: `@cf/llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf`
   - Language: `@cf/meta/llama-3.2-3b-instruct`
   - AutoRAG: Uses your configured dataset

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: AI requests hanging in development**
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: This is expected! Use `ENABLE_DEV_MOCKS=true` (default) for local development

**Issue: "AutoRAG dataset not found" in production**
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Create and populate your AutoRAG dataset with IICRC documents (see AGENTS.md)

**Issue: AI models not available**
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Ensure your Cloudflare account has Workers AI access and the models are available in your region

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/assess-damage
Analyzes uploaded images for water damage assessment.

**Request**:
```json
{
  "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "vision_analysis": "Detailed damage description...",
  "industry_sources": [...],
  "enhanced_assessment": "Professional assessment...",
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### GET /api/knowledge-search?q=query
Searches the RAG knowledge base for industry information.

## Architecture

The application follows a multi-step AI processing pipeline:

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads damage photo
2. **Vision Analysis**: LLaVA analyzes image for damage characteristics
3. **RAG Query**: AutoRAG searches for relevant industry guidelines
4. **Enhanced Assessment**: Llama 3.2 combines vision + RAG for professional report
5. **Results Display**: Comprehensive assessment with confidence scoring
